// thinking in opposite direction
// the problem want us to find the last smaller num behind current num.
// how do I find the last smaller num for current num
// two pointer?
// brute force would be O(n^2)
// if next num larger, can the second pointer reuse? No.
// to reuse second pointer, it has to be in an order so that we can ignore the previous small num.
// But should it be increasing or decreasing? We need to think about both cases
// 1. Increasing
// 1) next num larger, it could get a larger small num. what if we iterate the sorted list from 0.
// what if this larger small num is before current num, and only previous small num is behind it, wouldn't we miss that?
// so if the pointer pass it, that means previous larger num has recorded it. So it works.
// 2) next num smaller, all rest small num won't be match for current num.
// for those smaller num but behind current num, because previous larger num is also larger than it, so it can be ignored.


// bug: all smaller num index has to be calculated, because they are all valid, and smaller num could be event more behind
