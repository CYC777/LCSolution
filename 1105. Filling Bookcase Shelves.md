// feels like greedy
// what it similar height book put in a row when width <= shelf
// -> when you put a tall book, try utilize that row, try put prev and after book in that row
// what if try put as much as in a row, than remove from previous row if fits

// actually it's dp..
// think about state transition, dp[i] = (dp[i - 1.. i - x] + current height of (i, i - 1, ...))
// dp[i] means max height for i bricks
